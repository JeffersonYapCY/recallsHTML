  <h2>2023 - ENGIE South East Asia Pte Ltd</h2>
  <h3>Project Executive</h3>
  <p>
    I worked as a Project Executive with ENGIE South-East Asia, a multinational company specializing in construction and fabrication of chillers for both commercial and residential use. I prepared monthly financial reports for various projects for management review based on cost accruals and corresponding revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also performed billing on customers in a timely and accurate manner, and assisted the finance team in following up with ageing receivables to reduce their workload. In my core role, I assisted with budgeting and cash flow forecasting across projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within ENGIE’s finance team, I was given the opportunity to assist with verifying supplier/vendor invoices and processing payment for both approved SOA and non-SOA invoices, performing daily bank reconciliation, and posting journal entries in Microsoft Business Central. I also assisted with 3-way matching of invoices to track outstanding invoice payments.
